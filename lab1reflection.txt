1. We wrote a couple of helper classes that were needed, 
for example the Vector2D class is a class to help us with 2D vectors.
That class is closed for modification but open when you want to extend any of it. 
That means making other methods / operators for the vectors.
For example division, subtraction or the dot product. 
Everything could be possible. 

The "main" super class is Car where every car inherits from. 
It has functions that all cars should have, like getters and setters for different attributes.


2. Because the math is too complicated we chose to just increase the speed by a lot.
Then we tested if that speed is equal to the enginepower.
That would mean that our clamp methods worked!!!!!
Then we did almost identical test for the decrease of the speed.
